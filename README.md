Mongoodb has been used to store and to manage the data.  

Welcome to the README file for the DriveTest Booking Portal project. This project is a web-based application that allows users to book driving tests online. The portal has three different panels: user, admin, and examiner.

The admin panel allows the administrator to set available dates and appointment slots for driving tests. This ensures that users can book tests based on the available dates and appointment slots.

The user panel is designed for users who want to book driving tests. Users can select the type of test they wish to take, such as a G or G2 driving test, and choose a convenient appointment slot.

The examiner panel is for examiners who are responsible for conducting and grading driving tests. Examiners can update the results of the driving test and provide feedback to users.

MongoDB has been used to store and manage all the data related to driving tests. MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that provides flexibility and scalability to the project.

To get started with the project, you will need to have MongoDB installed on your machine. Once you have installed MongoDB, you can follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal
Run npm install to install all the necessary dependencies
Start the server by running npm start
Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the application running
The project structure consists of various directories, such as routes, models, controllers, views, and public. These directories contain different functionalities for the project.

In summary, the DriveTest Booking Portal is a web-based application that allows users to book driving tests online. The portal has three different panels for users, admins, and examiners, and MongoDB is used to store and manage all the data related to driving tests.
